# Blog Post 3: Black Mesa of Oklahoma

Black Mesa is seen by many scientists as the end of the plains and the beginning of the Rocky Mountains, and if you were to see it with your own eyes you would probably agree. Black Mesa is located in the extreme northwest portion of the panhandle of Oklahoma, and is the highest point in Oklahoma at *4,973 feet*. To put that into perspective the highest point in Missouri is 1,772 feet. From my hometown of Oklahoma City it is a six hour drive, with the last three of those hours being driven through a desolate and flat landscape. It is not until you are just a few miles from the Mesa's that they come into view and the landscape completely changes. I have been to Black Mesa the last three years, with the latest visit coming in July 2018. Black Mesa is actually my favorite place to hike and view wildlife in all of Oklahoma. The hike to the summit from the trailhead is 4.2 miles, so the hike usually lasts about four hours when I complete it. Not far from the preservation where we hike is a state campground, where we always set up camp after a long day of driving and hiking. The next morning we pack up and head off to Colorado. 

I believe the reason I enjoy Black Mesa so much is because it is so isolated from soceity. The closest town is located about ten miles away, but only has a population of 17. There are no city lights, noises, or large tourist businesses around Black Mesa, so when you are there you feel completely alone. Because of the lack of polution in the air, the nigh skies are some of the best in the entire country, attracting astronomers from all parts of the U.S. If one wishes to be alone, Black Mesa should be considered. 

## The Mesa

Black Mesa is an inverted valley, formed by erosion. Hardened lava is the culprit for the formation of the mesa's, and the valleys of prairie that fill their gaps. About 3-5 million years ago, a volcanic eruption occurred in the Clayton-Raton volcanic field. Basalt later filled the valleys, but the mesa surfaces and surrounding prairie floors, volcanic rock can be found with every step. Because of the large volcanic activity that filled the region, dinosaur fossils and bones have been found at an extremely high rate in the Black Mesa area. 

## The Flora

As with most arid climates, the flora comprising Black Mesa is rather simple. The entire mesa is composed of shortgrass prairie, with bluestem and gamma grass (Poaceae) making up the vast majority of it. There are two plants that are overwhelmingly abundant at Black Mesa: **juniper trees (*Juniperus*) and the cholla cactus (*Cylindropuntia*)**. For as far as the eye can see these two green flora are seen in numerous numbers and makeup the definitive western landscape of Black Mesa. Along with the junipers and the cholla cactus there are 23 confirmed rare species of flora in the Black Mesa preserve. This is one of the reasons Black Mesa has been described as like no other place in America, because it is the lone place where the Great Plains collides with the Rocky Mountains. 

## The Fauna

If you believed the flora of Black Mesa to be unique, you will think that even more of the fauna. Black Mesa is home to several animals and invertabrates that one will not see all together at once. Black Mesa is the only place not only in Oklahoma, but in the entire world where the documented species of fauna will be seen together. Like I said before, this is because of the collision of ecosystems between the prairies of the east and the mountains of the west. 

Pronghorn antelope (*Antilocapra americana*) are seen from a distance in small groups, as their keen eyesight guarentees a safe distance from all humans. The mule deer (*Odocoileus hemionus*) seem almost tame, as their large groups simply stroll by a human. Bighorn sheep (*Ovis canadensis*) also have a population at Black Mesa, as they use the steep mesas to traverse the area. Coyotes are abundant (*Canis latrans*), along with prairie dogs (*Cynomys*), and the badger (*Taxidae taxus*). Mountain lions (*Puma concolor*), bobcats (*Lynx rufus*) and black bears (*Ursus americanus*) are also seen on occassion.  Nine species of snakes are present, all of which are evolved to handle dry climates. Very rare amphibians, reptiles, and birds also inhabit Black Mesa. Bird watchers from all over flock to Black Mesa, to witness the diverse and rare 59 birding species. 61 species of butterfly and 91 species of moth are found at Black Mesa. 

My favorite invertabrate that I have encountered is the painted grasshopper (*Dactylotum bicolor*). Immense colors of orange, yellow, black, and green make it appear as if you are looking at a rainbow. My favroite reptile I have encountered is the Texas horned lizard (*Phrynosoma cornutum*). They are extremely docile and seem to actually enjoy being picked up and examined. As far as mammals go, the prongorn is my favorite, because you cannot see them in any other place in Oklahoma and they are such an icon for the western United States. 

## Final Words

Black Mesa is the kind of landscape in which western movies are made in. Black Mesa represents what the old west looks like; bare, dry, open, a rich ecology of biology. It is also lonely. It is not the kind of lonely that would make you sad though, it is the kind of lonely that makes you stop and stare all around Black Mesa and try to remember every detail, because it is so odd and inspiring. That is why I keep on going back, so I can continue to remember more and more of the one and only Black Mesa.
