# Blog Topic

My proposed blog topic is a narrative type of scientifc blog, using my own personal stories. These stories will focus on the specific animals (painted grasshopper, moose, bear, bison, etc.) and the environments (Black Mesa, Rocky Mountians, Wichita Mountains, etc.) they were in. They will focus around the activities of hunting, hiking, and camping. 

I hope these stories will educate my readers of the certain places and animals I have experienced, and inspire them to go those places to experience it for themselves.
