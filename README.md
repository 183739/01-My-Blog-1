# Blog Topic

My proposed blog topic is a narrative type of scientifc blog, using my own personal stories. These stories will be focused on my favorite hunting, camping, and road trips out west along the rocky mountains. My stories will be authentic and true, and I would like to incorporate scientific facts that I encountered during these stories, such as animal species, conservation, etc. 

The point of this blog is to entertain, inspire, and educate my readers. I am hoping the authentic stories will maybe inspire people to take up bird hunting, camping, or road tripping out west to enjoy the Rocky Mountains and many National Parks. I will educate my audience by explaining the importance of the animal and plant species I encounter along my stories, and how they pertain to conservation efforts and the history behind them.
