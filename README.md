# 01-My-Blog

# Blog Topic

My proposed blog topic is a narrative type of scientifc blog, using my own personal stories. These stories will focus on the specific animals (painted grasshopper, moose, bear, bison, etc.) and the environments (Black Mesa, Rocky Mountians, Wichita Mountains, etc.) they were in. They will focus around the activities of hunting, hiking, and camping. 

I hope these stories will educate my readers of the certain places and animals I have experienced, and inspire them to go those places to experience it for themselves. **My audience will be nature lovers who are looking for new places to travel to, and who may want to learn more about specific creatures**. *I will promote it by having a website and a way for my audience to email or call me to contact me.*

# What can I write specifically about?

I can write specifcally about the birds that I hunt and the places I have been. The places I can talk about, I can talk about the animals very clearly that were there. I have seen specific animals with my own eyes in these specific places on several occasions. These places where I have hunted, hiked, and camped are very etched in my mind, because I have experienced them first hand many times. I am also i conservation major, so I am constantly thinking of these places, flora, and fauna from a wildlife management perspective. I think giving a specific description of these places, and the fauna and flora that inhabit it, will educate, entertain, and inspire my readers. These specific places include: *Wichita Mountains in SW Oklahoma, Black Mesa in far NW Oklahoma, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River in SW Colorado, and the lake city area of Colorado, which houses many nationnal forest and mountain ranges, as well as the Alpine Loop Back Country Way*.

These specific areas house certain aspects such as:

-geologcal feautures
-flowers
-trees
-megafauna
-microfauna
-climate
-human impact/population
