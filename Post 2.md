# Blog Post 2: The Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma

The Wichita Mountains of southwest Oklahoma exlempify the western facade. Dryer weather, rolling prairies, boulder mountains, and easily spotted wildlife describe the area. I have been to the Wichita Mountains around *20* times, and every time I go back a new place is discovered or a new experience makes the trip worth remembering. Nearly all of the trips to the Wichita Mountains revolve around hiking one of the peaks on the preserve, or driving on all of the roads in search of the megafauna that call the prairies within the park home. One of my last trips to the Wichita Mounatains came in March 2018, when my dad and I went turkey hunting on a large piece of private property a family friend owned, which was situated right at the base of one of the goliath boulder mountains. It doesn't matter what time of year I'm there visiting or exactly what I am doing there visiting, it is a special place in western Oklahoma. 

## The Mountains

The mountains were shaped and built by a failed continental drift over **575 million years ago**. Granite is the definitive rock that most visitors will notice, but there are a multitude of other rock formations that are categorized by their color and aging. One rock may differ in color because it has been exposed to sunlight and weathering for only a certain number of millions of years. The mountains are a calling place for boulder hoppers, rock climbers, and geology enthusiasts because of the uniqueness and diversity of the geology of the Wichita Mountains. 

## The Flora

Since the Wichita Mountains is generally composed of mixed grass prairie. Grasses (*Poaceae*) found are usually little and big bluestem, Indian grass, switchgrass, and a variety of gama. These mixed grasses are the bulk of the food source for the great abundance of grazers on the wildlife refuge. Grass is the quentisential flora for the limited prairies of today, and is the calling card for the Wichita Mountains. During the summer months, numerous species of wildflowers engulf certain areas of the grasslands. They are a sweet treat not only the invertebrates, but also for the grazers and smaller vertabrates. Lining certain areas around the mountains are medium sized oaks (*Quercus*) and  cedars (*Juniper*). These provide shelter and food for the non-prairie favoring animals. 

## The Fauna

When visions of the western prairie come to mind, the one animal that is pictured in the American Bison (*Bison bison*). One of the largest bison herds in America inhabit the Wichita Mountains, and they are seen at nearly every turn in the refuge. White tail deer and Elk (*Cervidae*), Pronghorn (*Antilocapridae*),  and the Spanish introduced Longhorn cattle (*Bovidae*) make up the remaining grazing megafuna. There are also a few prairie dog (*Sciuridae*) towns where native prairie dogs can be heard chattering. Various carnivores call the Wichita Mountains home as well. Coyotes (*Canidae*), raccoons (*Procyonoidae*), otters (*mustelidae*), and birds of prey are well populated, while bobcats and mountain lions (*Felidae*) are seen on a yearly basis. The Rio Grande turkey (*Meleagris gallopavo*) and the Bobwhite Quail (*Colinus virginianus*) make up the huntable bird species. These very distinct animals are the definitive western fauna of the United States and can easily be seen at most times in the Wichita Mountains. 

## Conclusion

The Wichita Mountains are a grand place for all wildlife enthusiaists. The species richness of both fauna and flora is hard to come by in today's world and I hope someday you the reader can have the oppurntunity to experience them, along with the unique mountains themself.
