# Blog Post 4: Lake City area of Colorado

Lake City is the most isolated town in the lower 48, as it takes over 45 minutes to reach the next closest town. Lake City is locatd in Hinsdale County of south central Colorado and is the only incorporated town in the entire county. With isolation like this in the Rocky Mountains, the wildlife is prestine. Lake City is just the town for which many outdoor enthusiasts come in for supplies and what not. The national forests, mountain ranges, and Alpine Loop is what the people come for, including myself. I have been to Lake City three times, all within the last three years. The elevation of the campground my family and I have used is at an elevation of 10,000 feet and is considered in the alpine. It is in fact so elevated that whenever we camp, which is during the summer, we wake up to a frost covered campsite. But the alpine frost is well worth it, as the wildlife and scenic views of the Rocky Mountains give us a reason to endure the summer cold. 

## The Rocky Mountains

The Rocky Mountains got there name from the rocky look that they protrude. The rocks that formed the Rocky Mountains come from being raised from tectonic forces dating back to 1.7 billion years ago. These rocks in the southern Rocky Mountains formed into mountains about 300 million years ago, consisting of Precambrian metamorphic rock that were forced upward through layers of limestone laid down in the shallow sea. They later eroded throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, leaving behind sedimentary rock. The sedintary rock of southern Colorado continued to rise for millions of year, after tectonic rising and gradual erosion shaped the mountains into what they are today. During the pleistocene and holocene era of the ice ages, which were 1.8 mya-70,000 years ago, glacial landforms arose from the large ice movement. 

Specifically the San Juan mountains (which Lake City calls home) volcanic rock makes a unique appearance, from which they came 66-2.6 mya. The San Juan mountains are some of the highest in the Rockies, and are special because of the high altitude plateaus and peaks that are so prominent, and which can be seen from driving the Alpine Loop. The San Juan mountains are some of the best in the world when it comes to hiking 14ers, because they are accesible and can be climbed because of the plateaus present.
